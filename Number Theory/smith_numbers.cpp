/* 
    Given a number n, the task is to find out whether this number 
    is smith or not. A Smith Number is a composite number whose sum 
    of digits is equal to the sum of digits in its prime factorization.
*/

/*
    Examples:

Input  : n = 4
Output : Yes
Prime factorization = 2, 2  and 2 + 2 = 4
Therefore, 4 is a smith number

Input  : n = 6
Output : No
Prime factorization = 2, 3  and 2 + 3 is
not 6. Therefore, 6 is not a smith number

Input   : n = 666
Output  : Yes
Prime factorization = 2, 3, 3, 37 and
2 + 3 + 3 + (3 + 7) = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
Therefore, 666 is a smith number

Input   : n = 13
Output  : No
Prime factorization = 13 and 13 = 13,
But 13 is not a smith number as it is not
a composite number
